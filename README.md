NS – IBB 2024 – Final Assessment – Research/Design Proposal
You are designing a new immunomodulatory biomaterial for the in vivo reprogramming of cells for immune tolerance. In this case, you are trying to treat an autoimmune disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis. To do this, you need to design a biomaterial that can deliver two new synthetic drugs that can effectively reprogramme immune cells so they no longer attack healthy tissue. However, it is critical that drug A, which is weakly positively charged, is released quickly compared to drug B, which is also weakly positively charged, which needs to come out slower. This system needs to be created using fully synthetic polymers that are biocompatible.
Task: Design a biomaterial system that can enable this treatment strategy. Ensure that the cells can enter the biomaterial to effectively become reprogrammed. You can support your writing with figures and drawings as appropriate.
Requirements: Make sure to support the feasibility of your design with concepts and fundamental mechanisms covered during the class using at least代 写NS – IBB 2024 – Final Assessment – Research/Design ProposalC/C++
代做程序编程语言 300 words. You can further support your writing with references, if useful.
Your essay should be no more than 500 words and must include the following components:
1. Brief Review of Literature
Identify and discuss at least three scholarly sources relevant to your problem space.
Summarize existing findings, highlight the gaps in the current research, and explain how your proposed study addresses those gaps.
2. Method
Clearly state your research questions and proposed study design.
Provide a detailed rationale for your chosen methodology, explaining why it is appropriate for investigating your research questions.
3.References
List all cited works in APA 7th edition format.
Purpose: The purpose of this assignment is to work to bring together different fundamental concepts that have been discussed during the class and use them to begin designing a biomaterial system that can address defined design parameters. This is an important skill to develop in the growth and development as a new researcher.
